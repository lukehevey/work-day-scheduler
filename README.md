# Work Day Scheduler


## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to display JavaScript skills in order to create a daily work planner. A normal 9am-5pm time block exists so that important events can be added to the planner for better time management. The challenging part of this assignment was getting the content to save to local storage then get that saved information to stay on the page after the page reloads.
